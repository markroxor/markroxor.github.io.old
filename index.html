    So this is the “about” section, where I am suppose tell you about me. Well there is not much to tell about me.
    I am pretty boring except when it comes to programming and gaming,
    but I for sure know how cheer you up  :!  :)  :o  :O

    Coming back to the about part. This is Mohit R., a programmer, blogger and a CoD (yea in both sense) fan.
    About the education part – pursuing bachelor’s in Electronics And Communications (whaa..?) .
    Then about the skills part- lets see.. I said I held a penchant for programming so in the process I did cover a lot of ground but comparatively a little less depth. I know stuff like –

    Language – Python (can do pretty much anything with it “slowly”) ,C++(ehh) ,bash/shell(…)

    Web Framework – Django ,Jekyll ,Markdown ,Flask (a bit)

    Database – mySQL ,sqllite ,mongoDB(a bit)

    Team services – Git ,VSTS ,Agile development ,Azure cloud services

    Data Science- NLTK ,skit-learn ,matplotlib ,pandas ,theano ,numpy , Hadoop (for big data)

    GUI development – Pygame ,Qt(have done some serious stuff) , Adobe Photoshop(you’ll love my posters)

    Computer Vision – openCV ,simpleCV

    Weird stuff –  CCNA ,Metasploit ,Kali ,socket programming ,GIS

    Robotics – Raspberry-pi ,Arduino ,AVR(dare you look up the abv.) ,various modules etc.

    OS- Linux,Linux and Linux?

    Logical stuff – Algorithms ,Data Structures ,competitive programming (codechef rank ~ 940 something Lunchtime ~ 470)

    As I said a programming enthusiast, can’t stick to one thing.

    So that’s more or less about the “about” section.
